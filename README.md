## Auditing and Penetration testing
- [Auditing assigment](Others/auditing.pdf). Auditing our Ethical Hacing course's enviroment.
- [Penetration testing](Others/JarmoChallenge.pdf). Goal is to get root privileges of Linux machine.

## Reverse engineering
  - In [this](Others/reverse_engineering_1.pdf) task I had to find out the password of the program.
  - In [this](Others/reverse_engineering_1.pdf) task I had to find out the serial key of the program.
  - [This](Others/reverse_engineering_win_1.pdf) and [This](Others/reverse_engineering_win_2.pdf) are real Windows malwares that I analyzed

## Software Exploitation
  - [Stack buffer overflow](Others/SoftEx_stack_buffer_overflow.pdf)  "stack_1.c is a small program with a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. The program has multiple flags and the student receives points  for each flag reached."
  - [Shellcode part 1](Others/SoftEx_shellcode_1.pdf) "Create a shellcode (shellcode generated with metasploit won't do) for the different inputs for shell_stub and shelltest. You must use a shellcode which says the course's implementation code TTC6520-3002! and end it up with the exclamation mark (!) as a message in your shellcode. Provide a working shellcode which doesn't have any Null bytes in it!"
  - [Shellcode part 2](Others/SoftEx_shellcode_2.pdf) "Create a shellcode (shellcode generated with metasploit won't do) for the ALL different inputs for shell_1. You should use some course's implementation code TTC6520-3002! as a message in your shellcode. Second part of the assignment is to create, choose, or generate a shellcode that executes a system command. It is up to you to decide what the command is and what input method you want to use."
